Based on the user's requirements and technology preferences, I recommend the following technology stack for the Daily Highlight app:

1. Frontend: React
React is a popular and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It will allow you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application effectively. You can use React to build the user interface for the app, including the account creation, friend management, and daily highlight features.

2. Backend: Node.js and Express
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. You can use Node.js and Express to create the backend API for your app, handling user authentication, friend management, and daily highlight data.

3. Database: MongoDB
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is a great choice for this project as it can easily store and manage the user accounts, friend relationships, and daily highlight data. You can use the Mongoose library to interact with MongoDB from your Node.js and Express backend.

4. Backend Language: Python
Although Node.js and Express are recommended for the backend, if you prefer to use Python, you can use the Flask or Django web frameworks to build the backend API. Both frameworks are well-suited for building web applications and can be used to handle user authentication, friend management, and daily highlight data. However, using Python would require a different database solution, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, instead of MongoDB.

5. Additional Tools and Resources:
- Redux: A state management library for React applications. It can help you manage the application state more efficiently and consistently.
- Passport.js: An authentication middleware for Node.js that supports various authentication strategies, including social media logins.
- Socket.IO: A real-time communication library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It can be used to implement the chat feature for friends to discuss their highlights.
- Chart.js or D3.js: JavaScript libraries for creating interactive charts and visualizations. These can be used to display statistics about the user's completion rate.

In summary, the recommended technology stack for the Daily Highlight app is React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and additional tools like Redux, Passport.js, Socket.IO, and Chart.js or D3.js for state management, authentication, real-time communication, and data visualization. This stack will provide a solid foundation for building the app and meeting the user's requirements.
